<h1>Batkeeping Manual</h1>

<h2>General Hints</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you make a mistake you can usually roll it back by reediting whatever change you have done. Rarely an error will require a direct manipulation of the database. Contact an administrator for this</li>
<li>You can perform any operation in a new window or tab. So, for instance, if you are weighing a bat and you need to open a medical ticket for it, you don't need to stop your weight entry. Simply right click on the relevant link and work in a new window or tab. Once that is done, close the tab and return to the weighing operation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>New Cage</h2>
Whenever a new cage is to be created click "new cage". Fill in the details. If you leave "owner" blank then it will be treated as a non-protocol cage and will be set to be fed by animal care

<h2>New Bat</h2>
Click "new bat" to make an entry for a new bat and click "Create". Remember to assign the proper cage.

<h2>Weighing Bats</h2>
Click "Weigh Bat(s)" and select a single bat or a whole cage to weigh. Weigh time is also inspection time so enter any notes you have in the Notes text box. During the weigh operation you can also change the cage of the bat e.g. if the bat weighs too little and needs to be moved to a special cage. Remember to enter a cage change note in such a case.


<h2>Moving bats from one cage to another</h2>
Click "Move Bat(s)" and then select the source cage. Select as many bats as you need from the list (hold down CTRL key to select multiple bats), select the cage to move to and then click "move"

<h2>Deactivating a cage</h2>
A cage that has no bats and whose cage label has been removed should be deactivated (i.e. removed) from the database by clicking deactivate. Such a cage no longer appears in the current cages listing, though a record of it can be accessed through the "list all cages" link.

<h2>Deactivating a bat</h2>
A bat that has died or has been exported from the lab needs to be deactivated in the database. Click "deactivate" to complete this operation.

<h2>Medical Care</h2>
To view all current medical problems click "List medical bats". 

<h3>Noting a new medical problem</h3>
Click "New medical problem", pick a bat, enter a brief title, date and description and assign it to someone. Click "Create Medical Problem".

<h3>Proposing a new treatment</h3>
For each medical problem you can enter proposed treatments my clicking "New Treatment" from the listing of all the medical problems. For the finish date, if you want to do a one time treatment just leave the finish date as the start date, which will cause the proposed treatment to expire the next day.

<em>NOTE</em> Each proposed treatment is set up so that it will appear on the list of treatments to do once a day. So if you need a treatment that needs to be done twice a day e.g. morning and evening, then you need to make two proposed treatments one for AM and one for PM. That way for a given day we can keep track if the morning and/or evening treatments have been done.

<h3>Perform a treatment</h3>
In the list of medical problems, for each treatment there is a "do" link. Click this to indicate that a medical care action has been performed. If there is no "do" link then that action has already been performed for today.

<h3>End a treatment</h3>
Click "end" to close down a treatment for a given medical problem.

<h3>End Medical Problem</h3>
Click "close" to close down a medical problem for a given bat.
