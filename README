Instructions for setting up Animal Record Keeping (Batkeeping)

Batkeeping is a program for keeping records of weights and health of bats in a computer database. The aim of the program is to be a user friendly web application for the organization and maintenance of laboratory animals.

Some features:

Weight tracking with graphs
Automatic census keeping
Task management, with email reminders
Medical problem tracking
Protocol management
Batkeeping runs on Ruby on Rails, an open source web framework for developing database driven web applications.

It is our hope that others will get some benefit to having this software available, but it was built "in-lab" and customized for our specific animal care protocols and standards.
